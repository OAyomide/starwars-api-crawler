Starwars crawler

### What is this anyway? 🤔
I am a huge fan of StarWars and as such, enjoy anything relating to Starwars. Unfortunately, Disney doesn't provide us with an official API for their databank. So whats the better way to get it? Put on our Sith Lord robe, lightsaber in hand ⚔️ and figure out how to get it from their website.
#


### But aren't there other far more popular projects?
Yeah sure! [Swapico](http://swapi.co) is a good example. But the problem is that the databank is grossly not up-to-date.

The Starwars universe is ridiculously large and as such, the data is quite voluminous. Also, there are improvements to be made over the API. There can be better spliting of each character/planet/species, etc

Another reason is that the project seems not actively maintained any longer.

Also, learning is fun! And this is another opportunity to learn something new
#

### So what's the plan?
The plan is to have the API built from the crawler. This is however the crawler. The aim of this crawler is to provide us the data we need in order to make our API. We are crawling this data (RESPONSIBLY ⚠️)from the Starwars databank. We'll then use our own logic to sort into different categories/schemas/types.

For example: BB-8 will be crawled and saved as a robot. It can then be queried from the API endpoint.

### Are you going to actively maintain this?
Actually, I will try to. However ❤️ from other developers who love starwars will go a long way in making things move fast 🏃⏩. PRs, issues, ideas, tips will all be appreciated and are welcome.
